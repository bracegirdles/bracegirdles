# Hack Reactor Alumni Network

> The Hack Reactor Alumni Network (HRAN) is a social media platform for building/maintaining relationships within the Reactor Core network. 

> HRAN provides a platform for leveraging your Hack Reactor/Reactor Core peer network to accelerate your growth as a software engineer.  Build your own profile and link up with your fellow alumns to keep each other up to date on your job search status, current projects, and learning experiences.  Contribute to the networks value by posting self-authored articles on industry experiences and technical discoveries.  Consider this our own private LinkedIn, our *fulcrum* (if you will) to ease the burden of navigating our new journey.  

> THIS WILL BE UPDATED WITH A MESSAGE DIRECTED MORE TOWARD A POTENTIAL DEVELOPER!
