# Hack Reactor Alumni Network #

The Hack Reactor Alumni Network (HRAN) is a social media platform for building/maintaining relationships within the Reactor Core network. 

## Summary ##

HRAN provides a platform for leveraging your Hack Reactor/Reactor Core peer network to accelerate your growth as a software engineer.  Build your own profile and link up with your fellow alumni/alumnae to keep each other up to date on your job search status, current projects, and learning experiences.  Contribute to the networks value by posting self-authored articles on industry experiences and technical discoveries.  Consider this our own private LinkedIn, our *fulcrum* (if you will) to ease the burden of navigating our new journey.

## Problem ##
When you're new to a particular industry, a solid network is paramount to your success in landing a job and to your upward mobility thereafter.  Hack Reactor (and its sister schools) are a great place to accelerate the establishment of such a network, but this process must continue post-graduation.  Many people find networking to be a daunting, awkward, unpleasant process, but with the size of Hack Reactor's total pool of graduates, it doesn't have to be!

## Solution ##
HRAN allows you to easily link up not only with students from your own cohort, but with those from previous and current cohorts as well.  There are currently over 1700 graduates of the HRSF, and many more if we consider all of the Reactor Core sister schools.  What a great place to start!

## Customer Testimonials ##
  > *"Prior to registering for HRAN, I found networking with Hack Reactor alumni from previous cohorts to be awkward.  Though we shared common ground in a similar experience, there was no medium through which to begin comfortably interacting.  HRAN provides a means to keep myself in the loop about the experiences and successes of my fellow alumni and has expanded my professional network significantly."*
    --A Simple Peasant

  > *"[Our] whole is greater than the sum of [our] individual parts."*
